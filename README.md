## What it does  

Subtinator is a tool that help me to enum subdomains through crt.sh (currently).
It will be added some more subfinder throughout the version.  

## How it work

First you launch it with Python3, then it ask you the domain, you enter your domain in input and it search, sort the results if there are one, and save it in text file in this format: **YYYY-MM-DD-domain.tld.txt**  
exemple:  

```
python3 subtinator

enter the domain: google.com
searching
values found
10 domain found
---
done
```
